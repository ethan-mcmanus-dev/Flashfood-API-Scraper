### Day 3: Understand Data Flow
1. Read [DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md](DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md) completely
2. Trace the "User Login Flow" diagram in your code
3. Watch the browser Network tab as you login
4. Check PostgreSQL to see the user row created

### Day 4: Understand Real-Time Features
1. Read the WebSocket flow diagram
2. Open `backend/app/services/websocket.py`
3. Open `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
4. Open two browser windows and watch notifications appear in both

### Day 5: Understand Background Tasks
1. Read the scheduler flow diagram
2. Open `backend/app/services/scheduler.py`
3. Open `backend/app/services/flashfood.py`
4. Watch the logs as scheduler runs every 5 minutes

   → JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing, stored in localStorage

3. **"Explain your database schema"**
   → 5 normalized tables with foreign keys: users, stores, products, price history, preferences

4. **"How do you handle real-time updates?"**
   → WebSockets for push notifications, background scheduler detects new deals

5. **"What's your caching strategy?"**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### "Can't connect to backend"
**Solution:** Check `VITE_API_URL` in frontend/.env matches backend URL

### "Database connection error"
**Solution:** Run `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up` to reset

### "No deals showing up"
**Solution:** Wait 5 minutes for scheduler to run, or check backend logs

### "JWT token invalid"
**Solution:** Logout and login again, token might be expired

### "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Stop other services using ports 8000, 5173, 5432, 6379
